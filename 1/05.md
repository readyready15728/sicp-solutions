**Exercise 1.5**: Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the
interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order or normal-order
evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

```scheme
(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0) 0 y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

```scheme
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order
evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses
normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule
for the special form `if` is the same whether the interpreter is using normal-
or applicative-order: the predicate expression is evaluted first, and the
result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative
expression. 

â†³

Normal-order evaluation evaluates expressions on an as-needed basis, which
means that `p` will never be evaluated and the function will return `0`.
Applicative-order on the other hand evaluates all arguments to a procedure
when it is applied. `p` will be invoked, infinitely recursing, and `test` will
never return.
