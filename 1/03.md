**Exercise 1.3**: Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and
returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.

â†³

```scheme
(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (sum-of-squares x y)
  (+ (square x) (square y)))

(define (sum-of-squares-of-two-largest x y z)
  (cond ((and (<= x y) (<= x z)) (sum-of-squares y z))
        ((and (<= y x) (<= y z)) (sum-of-squares x z))
        ((and (<= z x) (<= z y)) (sum-of-squares x y))))
```
