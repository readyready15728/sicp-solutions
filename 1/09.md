**Exercise 1.9**: Each of the following two procedures defines a method for
adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures `inc`, which
increments its argument by 1, and `dec`, which decrements its argument by 1.

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each
procedure in evaluating `(+ 4 5)`. Are these processes iterative or recursive?

The first definition of `+` proceeds as follows:

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

Because the terminal function call in the `if` expression has deferred
computation as an input to `inc`, the definition is recursive. Compare the
other definition:

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
```

Though the definition is *syntactically* recursive, the important detail to
pick up on is that there is no deferred computation. The calls to `inc` and
`dec` do not involve any recursion and as such can be evaluated immediately,
which means that `+` can keep track of all that it needs to without waiting.
In turn it can inherit the stack frame of the previous call to `+`, making it
an iterative process. Said phenomenon is known as [tail call
optimization](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/310974/what-is-tail-call-optimization).
