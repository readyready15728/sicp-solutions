**Exercise 1.10**: The following procedure computes a mathematical function
called Ackermann's function.

```scheme
(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1) (A x (- y 1))))))
```

What are the values of the following expressions?

```scheme
(A 1 10)
(A 2 4)
(A 3 3)
```

Consider the following procedures, where `A` is the procedure defined above:

```scheme
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (h n) (A 2 n))
(define (k n) (* 5 n n)) 
```

Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the
procedures `f`, `g` and `h` for positive integer values of *n*. For example,
`(k n)` computes <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=5n^2">.

The values of the three expressions listed are straightforward to obtain as
their arguments only involve the set of easily tractable instances of
evaluating the Ackermann function. The values are 1024, 65536 and 65536
respectively.

As for the concise mathematical definitions, I chose the somewhat plebeian
move of inferring them empirically with increasing values of *n* and checking
to make certain. They are 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(n) = 2n">,
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=g(n) = n^2">
and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=h(n) = 2^{h(n - 1)}">.
