**Exercise 1.6**: Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why if needs to be provided as
a special form. "Why can't I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms
of `cond`?" she asks. Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be
done, and she defines a new version of `if`:

```scheme
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

```
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5
(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
```

Delighted, Alyssa uses `new-if` to rewrite the square root program:

```scheme
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots?
Explain.

The `if` special form in Scheme circumvents its typical applicative-order
evaluation and evaluates only one of its arguments rather than both.
Substituting `if` with a procedure worked in the first trivial instances where
recursion was not being used, but reimplementing `sqrt-iter` using `new-if`
always recurses into `sqrt-iter` and there is no way to reach the base case.
Thus `sqrt-iter` will recurse forever.
